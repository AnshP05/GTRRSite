  <h1>About Georgia Tech Run Club</h1>
  <p>
    The Georgia Tech Run Club is a student-led organization for runners of all
    levels. Whether youâ€™re training for your first 5K, pushing for a marathon,
    or just enjoy running with friends, GT Run Club offers a welcoming
    community. We meet several times a week on and around campus, and we also
    travel to races together across Georgia.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is to promote health, fitness, and camaraderie through running.
    Membership is open to all Georgia Tech students, regardless of experience
    level. Come join us and be part of something active and fun!
